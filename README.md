# Dividend Stock Finder

This Python script allows you to analyze dividend stocks based on specific criteria. It reads data from an Excel file containing stock information, filters the data, and extracts additional information from web sources.

## Getting Started

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Download the stock data Excel file from [this link](https://bit.ly/divchampsheet) and place it in the same directory as the script. Ensure that the file is named `stock.xlsx`.

3. Open the Python script in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

4. Modify the constants at the beginning of the script according to your requirements. You can adjust the filtering criteria and customize other settings as needed.

5. Run the script using a Python interpreter. The script will process the data, fetch additional information from web sources, and provide the results.

## Customization

You can customize the existing constants at the beginning of the script.
